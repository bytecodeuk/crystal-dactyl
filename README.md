# Revised Version of Crystalhand's Dactyl (Hactyl)
This is my version of the Dactyl with a number of modifications and additions.  I changed a number of constants to variables to make it easier to modify.

- Hotswap holder i designed (hotglue recommended)
- North switch orientation support
- Cutout for tiny little teeth in front and back of many switchs
- Renamed, commented, and cleaned up some of the code to make more readable
- Added pre-rendered STL files, and ZIP files for SCAD that generated the STL files.

Customization for dactyl
- Ergodox like layout for a wider range of supported keys
- Curve/slope front back and left/right for alphas and thumb controlled separately
- Thumb cluster layout
- Thumb offset and orientation angle
- Number of rows (5-dactyl or 4-lightcycle)
- Profile selection (ie high low or custom)
- Optional detachable wrist rests with customizable height and slope
